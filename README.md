# VanAssistant

This repository contains various scripts and functions that I use in my VanAsisstant project.

VanAssistant is a version of Home Assistant but then for mobile usage. In my case it is a Recreational Vehicle, RV, Camper or campervan.

The intention is to save configuration examples here, so that I can call them from my website named Rob-litjens.nl

Currently I have a RPI4 and a Teltonika RUTX50. I do want to control this router via MQTT, but it is not that easy as it looks like at this moment. Therefore I have setup ModBUS which is easier and there is a lot of data regarding this.
